# Season Participation

Seasons allow you to purchase access to multiple games at once, often at a discounted rate.

## What is a Season?

A season is a collection of games organized by a group with:

- **Recurring Schedule**: Games can be weekly, bi-weekly, or custom dates
- **Season Pricing**: Often cheaper than purchasing games individually
- **Guaranteed Access**: Access to all games in the season
- **Flexible Attendance**: Choose which games you'll attend

## Discovering Seasons

Seasons can be found on:

- **Homepage**: Browse all available seasons
- **Group Pages**: View seasons specific to a group
- **Seasons Page**: Dedicated page listing all seasons

## Season Details

Each season displays:

- **Name & Description**: What the season is about
- **First Game Date**: When the season starts
- **Location**: Where games are played
- **Pricing**: 
  - Season price (for all games)
  - Individual game price (if purchasing separately)
- **Total Games**: Number of games in the season
- **Spots Available**: How many season passes are available
- **Signup Deadline**: Last date to purchase the season

## Managing Season Game Attendance

### From Game Pages
- Navigate to any game in the season
- Use the attendance toggle to mark yourself as attending or not attending
- Changes are saved immediately

### Default Behavior
- Season members are automatically marked as "attending" for all games
- You can opt out of specific games by marking them as "not attending"
- If you mark yourself as "not attending" and there's no waitlist, you can change back to "attending"

## Season Waitlists

If a season is full, you can join the season waitlist to be notified when a spot becomes available.

### Joining Season Waitlist

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Season Status">
    Navigate to a season page. If the season shows "Full" instead of available spots, the waitlist option will be available.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Join Waitlist">
    Click "Join Waitlist" button on the season page. You'll be added to the waitlist immediately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Promotion">
    When a season spot becomes available, you'll be automatically promoted and notified via email.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Season waitlists work similarly to game waitlists - first come, first served. You'll receive an email when promoted with payment instructions.
</Info>

### Individual Game Waitlists

Even if you have a season pass, individual games within the season can be full:

- **Game Capacity**: Each game has its own capacity limit
- **Waitlist Access**: If a season game is full, you can join that game's waitlist
- **Season Member Priority**: Season members may have priority for individual game waitlists (organizer's choice)

<Info>
As a season member, you're guaranteed access to all season games, but individual games may fill up. Joining a game waitlist ensures you'll be notified if a spot opens.
</Info>

## Season Game Access

<Warning>
Before purchasing a season, games are locked and cannot be accessed. After purchase, all games become accessible.
</Warning>

Once you've purchased a season:

- All games in the season become clickable
- You can view game details
