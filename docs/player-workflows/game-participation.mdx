</Steps>

## Managing Attendance

After joining a game, you can manage your attendance status:

### Mark as Attending
- Default status after joining
- Your avatar appears in the attendee list
- You'll receive reminder emails before the game

### Mark as Not Attending
- Click the attendance toggle on the game page
- Your spot becomes available for waitlist players
- You can change back to attending if spots are still available

<Warning>
You cannot mark attendance for games that have already occurred. The system uses timezone-aware validation to prevent this.
</Warning>

## Waitlist

When a game is full, you can join the waitlist to be notified when a spot becomes available.

### Joining the Waitlist

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Game Status">
    Navigate to a game page. If the game shows "Full" instead of available spots, the waitlist option will be available.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Join Waitlist">
    Click "Join Waitlist" button on the game page. You'll be added to the waitlist immediately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    You'll see a confirmation that you've been added to the waitlist. Your position in the queue will be displayed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Joining the waitlist is free and doesn't require payment. You'll only be charged if you're promoted and accept the spot.
</Info>

### Waitlist Position

Your position in the waitlist determines when you'll be offered a spot:

- **First in Line**: You'll be the first to be promoted when a spot opens
- **Queue Order**: Waitlist positions are based on when you joined (first come, first served)
- **Position Display**: Your current position is shown on the game page

<Info>
Waitlist positions are automatically managed. You don't need to check back constantly - you'll be notified via email when promoted.
</Info>

### Automatic Promotion

When a spot becomes available, the system automatically promotes waitlist players:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Spot Opens">
    A spot becomes available when:
    - An attendee marks themselves as "not attending"
    - An attendee cancels their spot
    - Organizer increases game capacity
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Promotion">
    The first player on the waitlist is automatically promoted to fill the spot.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Email Notification">
    You'll receive an email notification that a spot is available for you.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Purchase">
    Click the link in the email to complete your purchase through Stripe checkout.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    After payment, you'll be added to the attendee list and marked as "attending".
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
You have a limited time to complete your purchase after being promoted. If you don't complete payment within the time window, the spot may be offered to the next person on the waitlist.
</Warning>

### Manual Promotion by Organizers

Organizers can also manually promote waitlist players:

- **Organizer Choice**: Organizers may promote specific players based on their preferences
- **Capacity Increase**: When organizers increase game capacity, waitlist players are automatically promoted
- **Fair Process**: Most promotions follow the waitlist order (first come, first served)

<Info>
If you're manually promoted by an organizer, you'll still receive an email notification with payment instructions.
</Info>

### Leaving the Waitlist

You can remove yourself from the waitlist at any time:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Game Page">
    Navigate to the game page where you're on the waitlist.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Leave Waitlist">
    Click "Leave Waitlist" button (replaces "Join Waitlist" when you're already on it).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Confirm that you want to leave the waitlist.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Leaving the waitlist is immediate and doesn't affect other players' positions. You can rejoin later if you change your mind.
</Info>

### Waitlist for Season Games

Season games can also have waitlists:

- **Season Full**: If a season is full, you can join the season waitlist
- **Individual Games**: Even if you have a season pass, individual games can be full and have waitlists
- **Priority**: Season members may have priority for individual game waitlists

<Info>
Season waitlists work similarly to game waitlists - you'll be notified when a season spot becomes available.
</Info>

## Season Games

Games that are part of a season have special behavior:

- **Before Season Signup Deadline**: Games are locked until you purchase the season
- **After Season Purchase**: All season games become accessible
- **Attendance Selection**: After purchasing a season, you can select which games to attend
- **Default Attendance**: Season members are marked as attending by default

<Info>
Season games are automatically unlocked once you purchase the season pass, even if the signup deadline hasn't passed.
</Info>

## Game Reminders

You'll automatically receive email reminders:

- **24 hours before**: "Get ready, you have a game tomorrow!"
- **Day of game**: "You have a game today!"

These reminders are sent to all players marked as attending.
