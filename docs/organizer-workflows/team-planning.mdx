# Team Planning

The Team Planner helps organizers create balanced teams for upcoming games based on player levels and positions.

## Accessing the Planner

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Organizer Dashboard">
    From your group page, click the "Organizer Dashboard" button. This opens the dashboard in a new tab at `esooo.co/[group-slug]/organizer`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Planner">
    In the sidebar navigation, click on the "Planner" tab. It's the second tab (located right after "Overview").
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Next Game">
    The planner automatically loads the next upcoming game for your group. If no game is scheduled, you'll see an empty state message.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
The planner only works for games that have at least one player who has marked themselves as "attending". Waitlist players and season members who haven't marked attendance are not included.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

The planner requires:

- An upcoming game scheduled
- Players who have marked themselves as attending
- At least 2 players to create teams

<Warning>
Only players who have marked "attending" are included in the planner. Waitlist players and season members who haven't marked attendance are excluded.
</Warning>

## Setting Up Teams

### 1. Configure Number of Teams

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Number">
    Use the "Number of Teams" input to specify how many teams you want (2-10).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Teams">
    Click "Generate Teams" to automatically create balanced teams.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Team Generation Algorithm

The system uses a sophisticated algorithm to automatically balance teams:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Goalie Distribution" icon="shield">
    **Priority 1**: Distributes goalies first, ensuring each team gets one goalie if possible. If there are fewer goalies than teams, they're distributed to teams with the fewest goalies.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Level Balancing" icon="trending-up">
    **Priority 2**: After goalies, distributes remaining players to balance total team levels. The algorithm finds the team with the lowest total level and assigns the next player there.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Position Distribution" icon="users">
    **Consideration**: While balancing levels, the system considers position distribution to ensure teams have variety in positions (Defender, Mid-field, Forward).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Equal Sizing" icon="scales">
    **Goal**: Creates teams of similar size when possible. If player count doesn't divide evenly, teams are filled sequentially.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Algorithm Details

1. **Separate Goalies**: Players with "Goalie" position are separated from others
2. **Sort by Level**: Both goalies and non-goalies are sorted by level (highest first)
3. **Distribute Goalies**: Goalies are distributed to teams with fewest goalies
4. **Distribute Others**: Remaining players are assigned to teams with lowest total level
5. **Calculate Stats**: After distribution, team statistics (total level, position counts) are calculated

<Info>
The algorithm ensures fair distribution but you can always manually adjust teams using drag-and-drop if needed.
</Info>

## Customizing Teams

### Drag and Drop

<Steps>
  <Step title="Desktop">
    Click and drag a player card to move them between teams.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mobile">
    Touch and hold a player card, then drag to another team column.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Visual Feedback

- **Desktop**: Player becomes semi-transparent while dragging
- **Mobile**: Black border appears around the player container when selected

## Team Management

### Rename Teams
- Click on the team name input field
- Enter a new name
- Changes are saved when you save teams

### Assign Emojis
- Click the emoji button next to each team name
- Choose from colored circles (defaults) or sports emojis
- Emoji appears on the game page when teams are visible

### Team Visibility
- Toggle the eye icon to show/hide teams on the public game page
- Hidden teams are only visible to organizers
- Visible teams are shown to all players on the game page

## Team Statistics

Each team displays:

- **Total Level**: Sum of all player levels in the team
- **Position Options**: Count of each position (Goalie, Defender, Mid-field, Forward)

<Info>
Statistics update automatically as you move players between teams.
</Info>

## Preview Teams

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Preview">
    Click "Show Preview" to see a formatted view of all teams.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review">
    Check team composition, names, and emojis.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy as Text">
    Use "Copy as Text" to copy team lists for sharing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Saving Teams

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Configuration">
    Ensure teams are balanced and named correctly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Save">
    Click "Save Teams" to persist your team configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    You'll receive a confirmation message when teams are saved.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Teams are saved per game. Each game has its own team configuration.
</Warning>

## Mobile Optimizations

On mobile devices:

- **Two Columns**: Players display in a 2-column grid
- **Compact Info**: Level shows as number only (e.g., "3" instead of "Level 3")
- **Position Letters**: Positions show as single letters (G, D, M, F)
- **Icon-Only Buttons**: Preview and Copy buttons show icons only

## Team Display on Game Page

When teams are set to visible:

- Teams appear on the public game page
- Players can see team composition
- Team emojis are displayed
- Teams are sorted by name

## Best Practices

    Use auto-generation first, then fine-tune manually
  </Card>
  <Card title="Check Stats" icon="bar-chart">
    Review team statistics to ensure balance
  </Card>
  <Card title="Preview Before Save" icon="eye">
    Always preview teams before saving
