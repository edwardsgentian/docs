## Capacity Management

### Initial vs Current Allocation

- **Initial Allocation**: The original number of tickets set when creating the game
- **Current Allocation**: Can be increased by organizers when promoting from waitlist

<Info>
When promoting waitlist players, the system automatically increases "Current Allocation" to accommodate them.
</Info>

## Waitlist Management

The waitlist system automatically manages players who want to join full games. As an organizer, you can view, manage, and promote waitlist players.

### Viewing the Waitlist

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Game Details">
    Click on a game name in the Games table to view full game details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Waitlist">
    If the game is full, you'll see a "Waitlist" section showing all players waiting for a spot.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Waitlist Details">
    The waitlist displays:
    - Player names and avatars
    - Position in queue (order they joined)
    - Date/time they joined the waitlist
    - Player level and positions (if available)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Waitlist Information

The waitlist table shows:

<Table>
  <TableHead>
    <TableRow>
      <TableHeader>Column</TableHeader>
      <TableHeader>Description</TableHeader>
    </TableRow>
  </TableHead>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>**Position**</TableCell>

    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>**Actions**</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Promote button to manually move player to attendee list</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

### Automatic Waitlist Promotion

The system automatically promotes waitlist players when spots become available:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Attendee Cancellation" icon="user-x">
    When an attendee marks themselves as "not attending", the first waitlist player is automatically promoted
  </Card>
  <Card title="Capacity Increase" icon="users">
    When you increase "Current Allocation", waitlist players are automatically promoted to fill new spots
  </Card>
  <Card title="First Come, First Served" icon="clock">
    Promotions follow waitlist order - first player to join is first to be promoted
  </Card>
  <Card title="Email Notifications" icon="mail">
    Promoted players receive automatic email notifications with payment instructions
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
Automatic promotion ensures fair, first-come-first-served access to available spots without requiring manual intervention.
</Info>

### Manual Waitlist Promotion

You can manually promote specific waitlist players:

<Steps>
  <Step title="View Waitlist">
    Navigate to the game details page and locate the Waitlist section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Player">
    Find the player you want to promote in the waitlist table.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Promote">
    Click the "Promote" button next to the player's name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Promotion">
    Confirm that you want to promote this player. The system will:
    - Move the player from waitlist to attendee list
    - Increase "Current Allocation" if needed
    - Send the player an email with payment instructions
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Manually promoting a player may skip others who joined the waitlist earlier. Use this feature carefully to maintain fairness.
</Warning>

<Info>
When you manually promote a player, the system automatically increases "Current Allocation" to accommodate them if the game is at capacity.
</Info>

### Increasing Capacity for Waitlist

You can increase game capacity to accommodate waitlist players:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Edit Game">
    Click "Edit" on the game in the Games table.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Increase Current Allocation">
    Increase the "Current Allocation" field to a number higher than "Initial Allocation".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click "Save" to update the game capacity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Promotion">
    The system automatically promotes waitlist players (in order) to fill the new spots up to the new capacity.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Increasing capacity is useful when you have many waitlist players and can accommodate more attendees than originally planned (e.g., larger field, additional time slot).
</Info>

### Waitlist Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Monitor Regularly" icon="eye">
    Check waitlists regularly to understand demand for your games
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fair Promotion" icon="scales">
    Generally follow waitlist order to maintain fairness
  </Card>
  <Card title="Increase Capacity" icon="users">
    Consider increasing capacity if you have many waitlist players
  </Card>
  <Card title="Communicate" icon="message">
    Let players know if you plan to increase capacity or have special promotion criteria
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Waitlist Statistics

The waitlist provides insights into game demand:

- **Waitlist Size**: Number of players waiting for spots
- **Demand Indicator**: High waitlist numbers suggest you could create more games or increase capacity
- **Player Interest**: Shows which games are most popular

<Info>
Use waitlist data to inform future game planning - high waitlists suggest strong demand for similar games.
</Info>

### Managing Waitlist Players

You can view additional information about waitlist players:

- **Player Profile**: Click on a player's name to view their full profile
- **Game History**: See their participation history with your group
- **Contact Info**: Access contact information if needed (respect privacy)

<Warning>
Only promote waitlist players manually when you have a good reason (e.g., balancing teams, accommodating regular members). Default to automatic promotion for fairness.
</Warning>
