# Budget Management

The Budget tab helps organizers track income and expenses for their groups.

## Overview

The budget view displays key financial metrics:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Money In" icon="arrow-down">
    Total revenue from Stripe payments for games and seasons. This is automatically calculated from all completed payments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Money Out" icon="arrow-up">
    Total expenses recorded by the organizer through receipt uploads or manual entry. Currently includes a placeholder value for testing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Balance" icon="dollar-sign">
    Net balance calculated as Money In minus Money Out. This shows your group's current financial position.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Budget Card Details

The Balance card in the Overview dashboard shows:

- **Cash In**: Total revenue from Stripe
- **Spend**: Total expenses (currently shows placeholder value of $5,000)
- **Balance**: Net amount (Cash In - Spend)

## OCR Features

The OCR system uses advanced image recognition to extract:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Amount" icon="dollar-sign">
    Extracts the total cost from receipts using pattern matching for "Total", "Amount Due", "Balance", etc. Handles various formats including commas and decimals.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Date" icon="calendar">
    Finds purchase dates near keywords like "Date", "Purchase Date", or anywhere in the text. Converts to YYYY-MM-DD format.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Merchant" icon="store">
    Identifies the store or vendor name from the receipt text.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### OCR Providers

Esooo supports two OCR providers (configured via `OCR_PROVIDER` environment variable):

- **Google Cloud Vision API**: High accuracy, requires Google Cloud setup
- **Taggun API**: Alternative provider, simpler setup

<Info>
If OCR extraction fails or doesn't find certain fields, you can always manually enter or correct the information before saving.
</Info>

<Warning>
OCR accuracy depends on receipt image quality. Clear, well-lit photos produce better results.
